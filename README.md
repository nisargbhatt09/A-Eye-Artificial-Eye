# A-Eye (Artificial Eye)

### A-EYE is a project that was build with a motive to address the issues faced by people who are visually impaired/blind.
- A-Eye consists of a pretrained object detection caffe model that was used to detect the objects. 
- The object classes were edited and all the classes useful to serve the purpose were only kept.
- The device that was made used Raspberry-Pi and a Pi-Camera along with touch, vibration and infrared sensors and all these things were packed in a casing similar to a VR headset.
- The device gave the output in the form of Vibrations and Audio signals which were heard through headphones.

#### This repo consists of the model that was used in the project along with weights file. This project was made with a view to address the issues of the blind people and was kept in L.J. Innovation Village, Ahmedabad. We will surely imporve upon the issues/lags in the code and introduce new features in the future.
